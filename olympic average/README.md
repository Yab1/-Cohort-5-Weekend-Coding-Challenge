The 'olympic average' of an array of numbers is calculated by discarding an equal amount of highest and lowest values from the array, and calculating the average of the remaining values.
This is useful in order to avoid abnormally high/low values in the array when determining the average.
Eg. for [5, 8, -100, 14, 23, 3000, 28], with a discard amount of 1, we would remove -100 and 3000 and calculate the average of [5, 8, 14, 23, 28]
Eg. for [5, 8, -100, 14, -200, 23, 3000, 28, 400], with a discard amount of 2, we would remove -100, -200, 400 and 3000 and calculate the average of [5, 8, 14, 23, 28]

The challenge is to complete the function below so that, given an array of integers and a discard rate, it returns the corresponding olympic average.

let olympic_average = function (values, discard_rate) {

    // complete
